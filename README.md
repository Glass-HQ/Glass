# Glass

Glass is a browser, code editor, and terminal in one app. Instead of switching between separate applications, everything lives in the same environment. Anyone can use the browser — developers also get an editor, terminal, and native platform tooling alongside it.

> **Glass is a fork of [Zed](https://github.com/zed-industries/zed).** We actively sync with upstream every week. Glass would not be possible without the incredible work the Zed team continues to do.

Glass is in **active development**. The focus right now is macOS, with Windows, Linux, iOS, and Android planned.

### What is Glass?

- **Browser** — A full browser. Browse, stream, work — you never have to touch the editor if you don't want to.
- **Code editor** — Inherited from Zed, with significant UI changes and native macOS components.
- **Terminal** — Built into the same environment.
- **Native platform tooling** — Build, run, and test iOS and macOS apps without opening Xcode. Manage App Store Connect without opening the web app.

For developers, everything is connected. Build a web app and test it in the same browser. Build a native app and run it without leaving Glass. Deep integration between these workspaces is the long-term vision.

### GPUI

Zed's UI framework, [GPUI](https://github.com/zed-industries/zed/tree/main/crates/gpui), lives in the same repository as Zed. We separated it into its own standalone repository at **[Obsydian-HQ/gpui](https://github.com/Obsydian-HQ/gpui)** and extended it with native iOS and macOS components, making it a framework that multiple apps can build on. We are also bringing iOS support to GPUI so that apps built with it can run everywhere.

### Contributing

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) for ways you can contribute to Glass.

### Licensing

License information for third party dependencies must be correctly provided for CI to pass.

We use [`cargo-about`](https://github.com/EmbarkStudios/cargo-about) to automatically comply with open source licenses. If CI is failing, check the following:

- Is it showing a `no license specified` error for a crate you've created? If so, add `publish = false` under `[package]` in your crate's Cargo.toml.
- Is the error `failed to satisfy license requirements` for a dependency? If so, first determine what license the project has and whether this system is sufficient to comply with this license's requirements. If you're unsure, ask a lawyer. Once you've verified that this system is acceptable add the license's SPDX identifier to the `accepted` array in `script/licenses/zed-licenses.toml`.
- Is `cargo-about` unable to find the license for a dependency? If so, add a clarification field at the end of `script/licenses/zed-licenses.toml`, as specified in the [cargo-about book](https://embarkstudios.github.io/cargo-about/cli/generate/config.html#crate-configuration).

### Acknowledgments

Glass is built on top of [Zed](https://github.com/zed-industries/zed), created by **Zed Industries, Inc.** — the team behind [Atom](https://github.com/atom/atom) and [Tree-sitter](https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter). Their work on the editor, GPUI, and the broader ecosystem made Glass possible.
